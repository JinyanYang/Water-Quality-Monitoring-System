# Arduino-Based Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring System

This repository contains supplementary material for the paper **"Design and Implementation of an IoT-Based Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring System"**, presented at **ICAC 2025**.

The project integrates **Arduino**, **multi-sensor fusion**, and a **Nextion HMI display** to build a portable, low-cost water monitoring solution.

## Project Overview

- **Hardware**: Arduino Mega 2560, pH sensor, TDS sensor, temperature sensor, Nextion HMI display  
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, serial communication, data logging  
- **Objectives**:  
  1. Measure water quality parameters in real time  
  2. Display results on a Nextion HMI screen  
  3. Enable IoT-based monitoring for smart water applications  
  4. Provide a low-cost prototype suitable for real-world deployment

## Key Results

- Successfully integrated multiple water sensors with Arduino platform  
- Real-time monitoring and user-friendly display using Nextion HMI  
- Validated system accuracy against standard measurements (error <5%)  
- Potential applications in **drinking water monitoring**, **aquaculture**, and **hydroelectric reservoirs**  

*(Figures such as system block diagram, flowchart, and display screenshots can be added to `figures/`)*
